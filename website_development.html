                <!--SOFTWARE USED-->
                <h1>Software Used</h1>
                <p>I used Visual Studio Code.</p>

                <h2>Extensions used in Visual Studio Code</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Auto Rename Tag By Jun Han: Automatically rename paired HTML/XML tag</li>

                </ul>
                
                <!--HTML & CSS-->
                <h1>HTML & CSS</h1>
                <p>Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) is a standard markup language for creating web pages. It describes the structure of a Web Page. While Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to style the Web page.</p>
                <p>I used references from w3schools, Jake Wright's: Learn CSS in 12 minutes and codecamp on YouTube.</p>

                
                <!--BASIC WEBSITE-->
                <h1>My First basic Website</h1>
                <p>On the second week of class, we were tasked to make our first website. I felt excited as it was something new to me and also related to my current course as it is what im currently learning as well in my Client Server Application Development CSAD module. It has always been something that i was keen to learn and know more about to hopefully in the future ill be able to create my own personal portfoilo website.</p>
                
                <h2>How my first basic Website looked like at first:</h2>
                <a href="main page ss.jpg"><img src="images/main page ss.jpg" width="700px"></a> <br>
                <a href="about page ss.jpg"><img src="images/about page ss.jpg" width="700px"></a> <br>
                <a href="Project page ss.jpg"><img src="images/Project page ss.jpg" width="700px"></a>
                
                <h2>How my code was at first:</h2>
                <p>index.html</p>
                <a href="main page index.png"><img src="images/main page index.png" height="300px"></a>
                <p>about.html</p>
                <a href="about page.png"><img src="images/about page.png" height="500px"></a>
                <p>projects.html</p>
                <a href="project page.png"><img src="images/project page.png" height="300px"></a>


                <!--CURRENT WEBSITE-->
                <h1>My Current website</h1>
                <p>On the third week, we were tasked to watch Learn CSS in 12 Minutes by Jake Wright. I would say that despite how long ago that this video was published, it is still useful to this day and definitely as a beginner this is a great video to watch as its a great guide in understanding the website layouts and how to code it in CSS. </p>
                
                <h2>My Website layout template</h2>
                <p>While watching Jake Wright's video as reference, i made my own template to look like this:</p>
                <a href="website layout template.jpg"><img src="images/website layout template.jpg" height="600px"></a>
                
                <h2>Main page</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li> I put dividers to be able to divide the page.</li>
                    <li>Then I made a new CSS file and link it to my index.html, from there I started working on the design of the main page in CSS. First got the padding and the widths in the correct pixels that I wanted then it came to choosing the background colors and fonts. I wasnâ€™t really pleased with the colors but I decided to leave it in as it helps me to see the dividers of the page itself until I could pick out a better background color for later.</li>
                    <li>I wanted to make the header turn sideways but I was not really able to do so, so I left it like that for now but I will come back for it once I figure out how to do it.</li>
                </ul>
                <a href="Main page day1.jpg"><img src="images/Main page day1.jpg" width="700px"></a>
                <p>index.html</p>
                <a href="main page code1.png"><img src="images/main page code1.png" width="700px"></a>
                <p>style.css</p>
                <a href="main page css1.png"><img src="images/main page css1.png" width="400px" ></a>
                
                <h2>About page</h2>
                <p>I used the template I started in the main page and copy over to the about page. But soon ran into a problem that my unordered list wasnt showing properly:</p>
                
                <h3>Error Displayed</h3>
                <a href="error list about page.jpg"><img src="images/error list about page.jpg" width="700px"></a>
                <p>So I decided to changed the id names to differentiate it from the main page so that in my CSS file will not be mixed up with the other pages.</p>
                <a href="About page 1.jpg"><img src="images/About page 1.jpg" width="700px"></a>
                <p>about.html</p>
                <a href="about page code1.png"><img src="images/about page code1.png" width="700px"></a>
                <p>updated style.css</p>
                <a href="updated css2.png"><img src="images/updated css2.png" width="400px"></a>
                <p>I made small changes also in the index.html page to not affect other similiar tags.</p>
                <a href="updated main page code2.png"><img src="images/updated main page code2.png" width="700px"></a>

                <h2>Project page</h2>
                <p>I decided to do something different to the navigation bar where if you hover over the project tab it will be able to show a dropdown of the list of projects I have done which for now it only has creating a website but as the weeks go by I will be able to update it.</p>
                <a href="Project page 1.jpg"><img src="images/Project page 1.jpg" width="700px"></a>
                <p>project.html</p>
                <a href="project page code1.png"><img src="images/project page code1.png" width="700px"></a>
